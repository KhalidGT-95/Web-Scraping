This is a python script that I wrote which changes the wallpaper of your home screen. It uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the data
from www.brainyquote.com in the form of images and sets these images as your wallpaper. To achieve the wallpaper changing effect, I have made a bash script whcih runs the python program and sets the wallpaper.
